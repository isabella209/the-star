<p>A DESQRIPTION ABOUT STARS:</p>

<b>
	A star is an astronomical object consisting of a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. The observable Universe contains an estimated 1Ã—1024 stars,[1][2] but most are invisible to the naked eye from Earth, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way.

		<p class="one_no">
	Our 1st question was:How would you describe stars?
	</p>
	<p class="question_no">
	<u>Answer:</u>	Describing the stars is made easy by this extract from the book 'Writing with Stardust'. For the stars, you should again focus on four main aspects: the colour, the reflection, the shape and using an effective simile. Try to think of the different components that make up descriptive writing.

		<p class="two_no_q">
			2nd Question was: Do stars explode?
		</p>
		<p class="two_no_ans">
			<u>Answer</u>Having too much matter causes the star to explode, resulting in a supernova. ... As the star runs out of nuclear fuel, some of its mass flows into its core. Eventually, the core is so heavy that it cannot withstand its own gravitational force. The core collapses, which results in the giant explosion of a supernova.

		 <p class="third_no_q">
		 	3rd Question was: What is a star simple definition?
		 </p>
		 <p class="third_no_ans">
		 <u>Answer:</u> A star is a very large ball of bright glowing hot matter in space. That matter is called plasma. Stars are held together by gravity. They give out heat and light because they are very hot. Nuclear fusion makes light and heat and makes bigger and bigger chemical elements

		<p class="four_no_q">
			4th no Question: How are stars born?
		</p>
		<p class="four_no_ans">
			<u>Answer:</u> Stars are born when large gas clouds collapse under gravity. They form hot cores that gather more and more gas and dust until a protostar is formed. ... The Sun formed from a very average sized gas cloud, and the bits left over stuck together under gravity to form the planets.

	<article>
		<p class="five_no_q">
			5.How the stars are made?
		</p>
		<p class="five_no_ans">
			<u>Answer:</u> Stars are made of very hot gas. This gas is mostly hydrogen and helium, which are the two lightest elements. Stars shine by burning hydrogen into helium in their cores, and later in their lives create heavier elements. ... New stars are formed from this material.
		</p>

<div>
	<article>
		<p class="six_no_q">
			6.What are the importance of stars?
		</p>
		<p class="six_no_ans">
			<u>Answer:</u> Plants and some microorganisms use it to produce energy via photosynthesis, and then the rest of the food chain depends on those creatures. So, stars are necessary to create the elements needed for life, and they are extremely important for creating the energy that allows life on Earth to live.

<div>
	<article>
		<p class="seven_no_q">
			7.How many stars are there?
		</p>
		<p class="seven_no_ans">
			<u>Answer:</u> There are an estimated one hundred billion (100,000,000,000) stars in our own Milky Way galaxy, although some estimates range up to four times that many, much depending on the number of brown dwarfs and other very dim stars. A typical galaxy may contain anywhere between about ten million and one trillion stars.
